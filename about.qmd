I'm a lifelong learner passionate about science—especially animal science—technology, and the power of data. I enjoy working with AI, programming, software development, modeling, and decision support systems to solve real-world problems in livestock production. I'm particularly enthusiastic about creating meaningful data visualizations and applying data-driven approaches to support decision-making in dairy and beef systems.
