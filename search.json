Developed in partnership between the Universidade federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ) and the University of Vermont, the project aims to improve forage analysis in tropical grazing systems through portable, field-ready technologies.\nObjective:\nTo enhance the accuracy and usability of portable NIR devices in predicting forage chemical composition under varying sample conditionsâ€”whether fresh, dried, or processedâ€”by identifying optimal preprocessing strategies.\nOutcomes:\n- âœ… Determination of the most appropriate preprocessing approaches depending on forage sample type (fresh, dried, milled)\n- âœ… Generation of calibration curves for use in future on-farm applications\n\n\n\nCotricalc System: Dairy Cost Estimation System\nDescription:\nCotricalc is a modular decision-support system developed in collaboration with Cotrijal, one of the largest agricultural cooperatives in Brazil. Designed to meet the specific needs of its dairy producers, the system focuses on accurately calculating milk production costs at the farm level, offering a customizable, transparent, and practical approach to financial management.\nObjective:\nTo support Cotrijalâ€™s technical team and member farmers in tracking costs, margins, and resource allocation by providing a user-friendly platform built with R Shiny and integrated with Google Sheets for dynamic data entry and reporting.\nOutcomes:\n- âœ… A fully functional and customizable milk production cost calculator\n- âœ… Built-in modules for different cost categories (e.g., feed, labor, reproduction, health, etc.)\n- âœ… Used as a technical and financial planning tool by Cotrijal technicians and dairy producers\n- âœ… Designed for scalability and future integration with benchmarking tools and dashboards\nðŸ”— Internal deployment under Cotrijalâ€™s technical extension program (in development)\n\n\n\nBehavioral Monitoring & Anomaly Detection System (Name TBD)\nDescription:\nA predictive monitoring system being developed in collaboration with Cotrijal Cooperative and CowMed, a Brazilian company specializing in dairy cow behavior monitoring through sensor-equipped collars. The system leverages high-frequency behavioral dataâ€”including rumination, feeding, and activity patternsâ€”to detect anomalies and provide actionable insights for farm management.\nObjective:\nTo support technicians and producers in identifying early signs of health or management issues, and to promote timely interventions that improve animal welfare and farm productivity. The system is intended to be integrated into the daily technical routines used by Cotrijalâ€™s advisory teams.\nOutcomes:\n- âœ… Predictive modeling using real-time data from CowMed collars\n- âœ… Detection of behavioral anomalies linked to health and performance deviations\n- âœ… Development of dashboards and alert systems to support day-to-day decisions\n- âœ… Customization for Cotrijalâ€™s operational structure and its member farms\nðŸ”— Internal development in partnership with Cotrijal and CowMed (underway)\n\n\nThis page is constantly updated with recent and ongoing work.
