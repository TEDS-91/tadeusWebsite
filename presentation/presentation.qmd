## Outline

- CalfSim Online Platform  
- Calf nutrition with high allowances of milk  
- NASEM (2021) Model in a high allowance of milk world  
- Feed intake observed vs predicted  
- Milk replacer composition × NASEM  
- Milk replacer fat levels  
- On-farm decisions based on data  
- Examples and templates  

---

## CALFSIM - Objectives

Provide dairy stakeholders (nutritionists, veterinarians, researchers):  

- Open-source and user-friendly tool to:  
  - Simulate performance of dairy calves  
  - Assess economics  
  - Use on-farm data to calibrate models  
  - Customize predictions to farm conditions  

---

## CALFSIM Basis

- Starter intake: NASEM (2021)  
- Temperate & subtropical conditions  
- Daily energy predictions for:  
  - Maintenance (temp correction)  
  - Gain  

---

## CALFSIM – Starter ME Calculations

- Based on Quigley et al. (2019): 15 kg cumulative NFC  
- Inputs:
  - Birth weight (kg)
  - Weaning age (days)
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Milk composition (CP, Fat, Ash, Solids %)
  - Starter (CP, Fat, NDF, NFC %)

## Whole Milk vs Milk Replacer

- Osmolarity:
  - 300 mOsm (Whole Milk)
  - 400–600 mOsm (MR)  
- Gut permeability & insulin sensitivity

---

## High Fat vs High Lactose – Ad Libitum

- Performance & ME use  
- Liver glycogen effects

---

## Metabolic Impact

- Minimal growth differences  
- Large changes in metabolic fingerprints  

![Metabolic Effects](images/metabolic_fingerprint.png)

---

## Gut Structure & Fatty Acids

- Whole milk powder vs MR  
- Gut fatty acid composition

![Gut Composition](images/gut_fatty_acids.png)

---

## MR Fat Levels and Oil Ratios

- Fat levels: 17%, 24%, 31%  
- Coconut:Palm oil ratio trials

## Final Thoughts

**Are we ready to model high allowance diets?**  
**What about individual calves?**
