The goal is to offer a reproducible, open-source alternative for academic and practical use.\n\n\n\nCotricalc System: Dairy Cost Estimation Tool\nA modular decision-support platform under development in partnership with Cotrijal cooperative. Built using Shiny + Google Sheets, the tool aims to help producers monitor costs, margins, and resource allocation for dairy production in southern Brazil.\n\n\n\nBehavioral Monitoring & Anomaly Detection\nBuilding predictive models using sensor data (e.g., rumination, feeding, activity) to identify behavioral anomalies and management deviations. Intended for integration into daily routines by producers and technicians to improve welfare and productivity.\n\n\nThis page is constantly updated with recent and ongoing work.
